\title{Multiple Regions Connection Plot}
\usage{
multipleRegion_plot(input, significance = 0.05, regionCodeProvided = FALSE,
  view = "coronal", color = "blue", screenShot = "None")
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{it can accept two types of argument:
(1) output generated by "permkCCA_multipleRegion(...)" (with p value). 
(2) output generated by summary_kcca() or meanConnection() (without p value).}

\item{significance}{significance level of hypothesis testing. 
If there is no p value in your data (i.e. only region name and 
region index, then set significance as NA)}

\item{regionCodeProvided}{use TRUE if region code was provided in nii2RData() 
funciton and FALSE if not.}

\item{view}{view of brain to see. One can choose coronal, axial, SL, or SR.}

\item{color}{color of dots and lines. User can specify multiple colors in this
argument and the function will use these colors periodically.}

\item{screenShot}{whether to save figure as png. If it is "None", then the 
figure will not be saved; If it is a name, for example, "plot.png",
then it will be saved as "plot.png".}
}
\value{
1-4 view(s) (depends on the number of views user would like to see) 
of brain graphic network. All significant regions are connected by colored lines.
}
\description{
This function can draw connection line(s) among multiple brain regions, 
based on the result from funciton permkCCA_multipleRegion(...).
}
\details{
If you provide an input with multiple patients, the function will ask 
you to specify which patients data you would like to use.

\examples{
 
#result<-permkCCA_multipleRegion(imageDat = "preproc_con21_rest_MNI_2mm", 
#region = c(1,5,10), col="green")
#multipleRegion_plot(result, view="axial")
